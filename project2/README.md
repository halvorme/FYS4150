# FYS4150 - Project 2

To build the program run

`g++ main.cpp src/\*.cpp -larmadillo -I include -o main.exe`.

Before you run the code create the two folders to save output data and figures

`mkdir data imgs`.

To generate the data, run 

`./main.exe`.

To generate the plots, run

`python plot.py`.

The results of the tests in Problem 2-4 are written to terminal. The results of Problem 5 and 6 will be found in `data/` and `imgs/`.

Headers and source code are found in `include/` and `src/`, respectively.
