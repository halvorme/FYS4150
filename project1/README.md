# FYS4150 - Project 1

To build the program run
> g++ main.cpp src/\*.cpp -I include -o main.exe

Before you run the code create the two folders to save output data and figures
> mkdir data imgs

To generate the data, run 
> ./main.exe

To generate the plots, run
> python plot.py

For problem 7 and 10 the maximal number of steps on the x-axis is set by the two variables at the top of the main function.
Similar variables has to be set in 'plot.py' for problem 7 and 8.
